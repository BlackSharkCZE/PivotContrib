"guretzki" as part of the Apache Extras "pivot-contrib" project.
================================================================

This project contains a number of helpers which are not part of Apache Pivot but are useful in a generic way.
A jar without debug information is available at http://code.google.com/a/apache-extras.org/p/pivot-contrib/ under "downloads".
So is another jar with the JavaDoc code.

For getting started, look at the JavaDoc overview at
http://svn.codespot.com/a/apache-extras.org/pivot-contrib/trunk/guretzki/doc/index.html
